== Agenda

* What do we need?
* What parts of Apache Flex can help?
* Why is Flex so great for building (IoT) applications?
* Demo

== What do we need?

* Server application a client can talk to
* Client that talks to the server
* Logic on the server that talks to the IoT hard/software

== What parts of Apache Flex can help?

* BlazeDS as communication endpoint to any client
* Flex client as frontend

[NOTE.speaker]

Actually the IoC Code is the only part that we have to implement
But we're thinking of a BlazeDS MQTT Messaging Adapter to link Flex Messaging and MQTT together
--

== Why is Flex so great for building (IoT) applications?

=== On the Server

* BlazeDS-Spring-Boot-Starter
** Automatically configures the BlazeDS server
** Using Spring-Flex for configuring the details
** Activated by providing a "META-INF/flex/services-config.xml"

=== On the Server

* BlazeDS
** Server-Push with graceful downgrade to long-polling and normal (short) polling
** Remoting (call method on server)
** Messaging (JMS-Like publish-subscribe)
*** JMS integration possible
** Automatic serialization/deserialization
** Strongly typed

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* Full JMS integration easily configurable
--

=== On the Server

* Spring-Flex
** Make Spring bean accessible by annotating with @RemotingDestination
** Takes care of configuring BlazeDS for Spring
** Integrates BlazeDS into Spring
*** Spring Messaging
*** Spring Security
*** ...

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* Spring-Messaging or default ActionScript Messaging
--

=== On the client

* Strongly typed model
* Client-Side model auto-generated from server model
* Deployable as native application on Android and IOs devices
* Skinning

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* As the client model is generated from the server model they are always in sync
* Also deployable on Windows, Mac, Linux as native applications or on any platform with Adobe Air runtime
* Also runable on Browsers, if Flash is enabled.
